              candid posing, natural interaction, same scene with different camera positions, slight camera movement (subtle changes forward/back, left/right, up/down)；
              the two subjects may look into the distance or slightly past the lens, with natural expressions；
              strictly prohibit square composition (no square / no 1:1)；
              keep the framing in portrait or landscape, not 1:1；
              visual storytelling with a sense of flow, non-repetitive shots, and consistent spatial continuity.
